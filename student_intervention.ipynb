    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",

In brief, the kNN classifier required the least computing power, but would require more training observations in order to increase model performance. ALso, the computation time of K-NN increases a lot faster with increase in data size. The RF classifier achieved a higher performance, but required significantly more training and prediction computing time. The SVM classifier achieved a similar level of performance to the RF, but required approximately much less computing time. Further, the F1 scores for the training and testing sets were constant independent of the number of observations utilized for training, suggesting the model's performance would not decrease given less training observations.All these factors if taken together, suggests us to choose SVM as the optimal algorithem which is to be further tuned to achieve this project's objectives."

    "\n",
    "In our current project, the chosen SVM model involves finding the hyperplane that best separates the passing students and failing students with the maximum margin. But the features in this prediction are not distributed regularly in two part, so there is no way to draw a straight line to separate them. Here comes the advantage of SVM. The algorithm is still very much effective in classification of the complex data sets that are not linearly-separable. This is due to the fact that an SVM classifier can accept almost any equation for the boundary of classification. For instance, if data where not separable by a straight line, an SVM could find quadratic or polynomial curves. If the data is still not separable, an SVM could transform the feature data into higher dimensions and draw a high dimension classification boundary. The variety of equations (called kernels) that can be used for separation is limitless in SVM, making it highly popular classification tool. In our project, the algorithm can find a spearating hyperplane based on the student features passed and failed. E.g. students with parents who went to college, live near the school, have good health, etc will be on the \"pass\" side of the hyperplane and the remaining students on the \"fail\" side of the hyperplane. Thus when a new student comes along, SVM will see which side the new student falls on and will make a pass/fail prediction."
